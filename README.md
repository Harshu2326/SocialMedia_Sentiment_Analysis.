# Social Media Sentiment Analysis

## Overview
This project performs **sentiment analysis** on social media posts (simulated tweets) to classify them as **Positive, Negative, or Neutral**. It demonstrates an **end-to-end data analytics workflow**, including data handling, text analytics, visualization, and interpretation.

The notebook is **interactive and portfolio-ready**, featuring both static and interactive plots, word clouds, CSV export, and future-ready options for **live Twitter API integration**.

## Features
- **Sample Dataset**: Simulated social media posts for analysis  
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Uses TextBlob to determine Positive, Negative, or Neutral sentiments  
- **Visualizations**:
  - Static sentiment distribution (Matplotlib & Seaborn)  
  - Interactive sentiment distribution chart (Plotly)  
  - Word clouds for Positive and Negative posts  
- **Insights**: Automatically summarized observations  
- **CSV Export**: Saves results for further analysis or portfolio presentation  
- **Future Upgrade**: Optional integration with live Twitter API to fetch real-time tweets

## How to Run
1. Open the notebook in **Google Colab** or **Jupyter Notebook**  
2. Run all cells sequentially  
3. The CSV file `social_media_sentiment_results.csv` will be automatically generated  
4. Explore the **interactive Plotly chart** and **word clouds** for deeper insights
